# Forging Electrons

## How to use

To start forging electrons, download the folder or fork the repo (I think downloading the folder is more straightforward because this repo is a mess at the moment).
Make sure you're in the `forging-electrons` folder then run `npm install` to install the necessary packages and then `npm start` to launch the application.

## Process

Iâ€™ve spent the greater part of the last two weeks trying to figure out integrating `three.js` into an electron app. After hitting more walls than I can count, I finally summoned the courage to go further out of my comfort zone and try some technologies I wasnâ€™t (still am not :) ) familiar with - `electron forge` and `react three fiber`.
This is the documentation of the process.

### Electron-Forge

The first step was setting up an app template using electron forge. For anyone who is unfamiliar at this point, electron forge is an all-in-one tool for packaging and distributing electron applications. Now that thatâ€™s out of the way, lets create a new app. Iâ€™ll be using the electron forge vite template (why? thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m familiar with)

```bash
npx create-electron-app@latest forging-electrons --template=vite
```

This should initialize your app and install the basic dependencies to get your app running. To test where weâ€™re at to make sure everything initialized correctly, change directory to your app folder - `cd forging-electrons`, then run `npm start` to launch the app.

This is what my app looks like on first launch. I think the window is too small especially with dev tools open. To increase the window size, Iâ€™ll adjust the height and width of the main window in `forging-electrons/src/main.js` (the main process of the app). In order to see the changes you made, you need to restart the app by using `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or closing the app as you would other apps.

Iâ€™m not sure how easy it is to tell from both pictures that the second one is bigger but it is, trust me :).

### React

Hereâ€™s a list of packages that need to be added to the project so we can proceed:

- react âœ”
- react-dom âœ”
- material ui (@mui) âœ”
- react-three/drei âœ”
- react-three/fiber âœ”
- types/three âœ”
- three âœ”

```bash
npm install --save react react-dom 
```

Running these first will install the latest versions of the packages. However, the current version of react and react-dom are 19.0.0 and as of today, React Three Fiber (R3F) version 8 is not compatible with react-19. Because of this, we need to remove the packages we installed and specify which version of react we want to install and thatâ€™ll be `18`.

```bash
npm uninstall react react-dom
```

```bash
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
```

Now we can proceed to installing the other dependencies:

```bash
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @fontsource/roboto @mui/icons-material
```

Now that all the necessary dependencies for the project are installed, we can relaunch the app and start adjusting and writing code.

### Code

In order to get rid of a security warning youâ€™ll get in the console by default;

![CSP_Error_Shot_04](./forging-electrons/public/screenshots-docs/Shot_04.png)

we need to add some instructions (CSP - Content Security Policy) to the `head` of the `index.html` file. A CSP is used to control what resources the app can load and execute.

```html
<meta
      http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';"
    />
```

This CSP basically tells the app to only allow scripts from within the app and block other elements. Itâ€™s probably a good time to adjust the `webPreferences` in the `main.js` file.

```javascript
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 1500,
    height: 900,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: false,//add this line
      contextIsolation: true,//and this line
      preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
    },
  });
```

#### Resetting body styling

This is the next step Iâ€™m taking by editing the contents of the `forging-electrons\src\index.css` file. You can do this how you want, hereâ€™s how I did mine:

```css
body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica,
    Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0; /* edit */
  padding: 0; /* edit */
}
```

#### index.html

Iâ€™m moving on to the  `forging-electrons\index.html` file now. Here Iâ€™m going to edit the title, create a container for my page (react) and also edit the script. By default, the script has itâ€™s source set to `/src/renderer.js`, but thatâ€™s not going to work.
To have our page be rendered with react as intended, a new `renderer.jsx` file should be created in the same directory. You can also clear this part of the file.

```html
<h1>ðŸ’– Hello World!</h1>
<p>Welcome to your Electron application.</p>
```

Now this is what the body of my HTML looks like

```html
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/renderer.jsx"></script>
  </body>
```

If youâ€™re wondering why Iâ€™m not including the full code blocks, itâ€™s because I donâ€™t want to just bloat up this documentation. The whole app will be available on one of my GitHub repositories.

At this point, the app is completely empty;

![Empty App](./forging-electrons/public/screenshots-docs/Shot_05.png)

The rest of this documentation might be blurry, as I myself donâ€™t fully understand what some of my code is doing. Iâ€™ll do my best to explain what I can anyway

#### renderer.jsx

This might not be the most logical next step, but I want to tackle it with gradually increasing complexity.

Before I proceed, I will create all the necessary files now.

- App.jsx
- MonitorScene.jsx
Both of these files go in the `src` folder.
I will also add a public folder that has my monitor.obj as well as a HDR image I will be using for the environment later to the `forging-electrons` directory .

Next I include my imports and create a root variable that targets a DOM element with ID `root`.  `CssBaseline` normalizes the CSS across browsers. I have a feeling that using `CssBaseline` is sort of redundant because I already manually reset the `index.css` file. In my mind, Iâ€™m thinking about it as a fail safe.

```jsx
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <>
    <CssBaseline />
    <App />
  </>
);
```

#### MonitorScene.jsx

It starts to get pretty interesting here especially if youâ€™re not familiar with `Three.js` or `React`. Iâ€™m not going to go into as much detail as I have up till now because itâ€™s pretty complex and lengthy from here.

I first create a Rig function that adjusts the cameraâ€™s position to create the effect that the monitor is reacting to the pointer location.

After finishing my import statements, I decided it makes sense to switch to the `App.jsx` file because I want to see something rendered in my app. I donâ€™t want to write a bunch of code and have to be looking for errors later. Iâ€™ll come back here when Iâ€™ve rendered some basic content in through the `App`.

Trying to import `MonitorScene` from `MonitorScene.jsx` will throw an error in the console because `App.jsx` canâ€™t find a function inside the file. To fix this, I appended the code below to handle this error

```jsx
export default function MonitorScene() {
  return <Canvas>{/* Fake content */}</Canvas>;
}
```

##### After App.jsx

Now I came back here to build out the functions and objects I need for my scene. Thereâ€™s not much to say besides the fact that I replaced `{/* Fake content */}` with actual content.

#### App.jsx

This file is whatâ€™s responsible for the content rendered in the application. To render a simple gradient background - which happens to be my app background, add this after your imports.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        display: "flex",
        height: "100vh",
        background: "linear-gradient(to bottom right, #6a00f4, #b44ac0)",
      }}
    ></Box>
  );
}
```

Now it should look like this;

![App Gradient Background](./forging-electrons/public/screenshots-docs/Shot_06.png)

Now Iâ€™ll add a drawer and bunch of other elements for the app.
After a bunch of tinkering, I pretty pleased with where the app is now. I also understand whatâ€™s going on more but still wonâ€™t go into details much because my aforementioned reason.

![Forging-Electron-GIF-01.gif](./forging-electrons/public/screenshots-docs/Forging-Electron-GIF-01.gif)

Now Iâ€™m done with the `App.jsx` file (for now :). It looks identical to the gif above. Now to the `MonitorScene.jsx` file.

### Current State

![Forging-Electron-GIF-02.gif](./forging-electrons/public/screenshots-docs/Forging-Electron-GIF-02.gif)

This is where the app is. Iâ€™ll push all the work Iâ€™ve done to the repository so that the journey to this point is documented. I didnâ€™t show it here but resizing the app window breaks the camera because Iâ€™m not handling window-resize event yet.

#### Resize Event

Iâ€™ve just learned that R3F automatically handles window resizing and one of the elements of my `MonitorScene` overrides this. This is the source of the conflict.

```react
export default function MonitorScene() {
 return (
  <Camera></Camera>
  <Stage
         intensity={1}
         environment="city"
         shadows={{ type: "accumulative", bias: -0.001, 
         intensity: Math.PI }}
         adjustCamera={true} // <-- conflict
      ></Stage>
 )
}
```

Setting `adjustCamera` to `false` should resolve the conflict.

```react
export default function MonitorScene() {
 return (
  <Camera></Camera>
  <Stage
         intensity={1}
         environment="city"
         shadows={{ type: "accumulative", bias: -0.001, 
         intensity: Math.PI }}
         adjustCamera={false} // solved
      ></Stage>
 )
}
```

### Moving Forward

I still plan to implement functionality into the buttons. I wanna take a short organizational break.

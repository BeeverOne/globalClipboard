                We introduced the "EcoWave Induction Cooktop," an innovative
                kitchen appliance that combines rapid heating with minimal

                induction technology, enhancing user safety features, and
                designing an intuitive touch-control interface. Lamboskeeee!
                That this isn't what I wanted but who am I kidding? I know
